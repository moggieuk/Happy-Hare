      Toolhead type (extruder and hotend combo)
      If your toolhead appears in this list you are lucky and can benefit from tuned values
      from others. It is still recommended you learn how to measure and calibrate your own
      because of the number of modifications and versions of hardware. If you are unsure,
      just select the default and perform calibration as described in the wiki
