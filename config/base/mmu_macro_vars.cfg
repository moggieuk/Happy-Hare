# Goal: Happy Hare supporting MACRO configuration
#
# (\_/)
# ( *,*)
# (")_(") Happy Hare Ready
#
#
# Supporting set of macros supplied with Happy Hare can be customized by editing the macro "variables" declared here.
#
# This configuration will automatically retained and upgraded between releases (a backup of previous config files will
# always be made for your reference). If you want to customize macros beyond what is possible through these variables
# it is highly recommended you copy the macro to a new name and change the callback macro name in 'mmu_parameters.cfg'
# That way the default macros can still be upgraded but your customization will be left intact
#


# PERSISTED STATE ---------------------------------------------------------
# Happy Hare stores configuration and state in the klipper variables file.
# Since klipper can only be a single 'save_variables' file, if you already
# have one you will need to merge the two and point this appropriately.

description: Happy Hare sequence macro configuration variables
gcode: # Leave empty

# Parking and movement controls:
# Happy Hare defines 7 operations that may require parking. You can specify
# whether to park for each of those operations both during a print and
# standalone (not printing) with Happy Hare or when HH is disabled:
#
# enable_park_printing
#    This is a list of the operations that should result in toolhead parking
#    while in a print. There are really two main starting points from which
#    you can customize. If using the slicer to form tips (and toolchange is
#    over the wipetower) you don't want to park on "toolchange" but you would
#    want to on "runout" which is a forced toolchange unknown by the slicer.
#    Typically you would also want to park at least on pause, cancel and
#    complete if not done elsewhere
#
# enabled_park_standalone
#    List of the operations that should result in toolhead parking when not
#    printing, for example, just manipulating the MMU manually or via
#    Klipperscreen. Really it is up to you to choose based on personal
#    workflow preferences but this defaults to just 'pause,cancel'
#    (i.e. disabled for toolchange)
#
# enabled_park_disabled
#    List of the operations that should result in toolhead parking when MMU is
#    disabled (MMU ENABLE=0) and using Happy Hare client macros. Note that only
#    pause and cancel can occur in this mode and would typically be enabled
#
# The operations are as follows:
#   toolchange - normal toolchange initiated with Tx or MMU_CHANGE_TOOL command
#   runout     - when a forced toolchange occurs as a result of runout
#   load       - individual MMU_LOAD operation
#   unload     - individual MMU_UNLOAD/MMU_EJECT operation
#   complete   - when print is complete (Happy Hare enabled)
#   pause      - a regular klipper PAUSE
#   cancel     - a regular klipper CANCEL_PRINT
#
# It is possible to call the parking macro manually in this form should you wish
# to include in your macros.
#
#    _MMU_PARK FORCE_PARK=1 X=10 Y=10 Z_HOP=5
#
# restore_xy_pos
#    Controls where the toolhead (x,y) is returned to after an operation that
#    invokes a parking move:
#   last - return to original position before park (frequently the default)
#   next - return to next print position if possible else last logic will be applied.
#          In print this reduces dwell time at the last position reducing blobbing
#          and unnecessary movement. Only applied to "toolchange" operation
#   none - the toolhead is left wherever it ends up after change. In a print the
#          next gcode command will restore toolhead x,y position
#
# Notes:
# - The starting z-height will always be restored, thus the different between 'next'
#   and 'none' is the z-height at which the (x,y) move occurs and the location of
#   of any un-retract
# - The default parking logic is a straight line move to the 'park_*' position.
#   To implement fancy movement and control you can specify your own
#   'user_park_move_macro' to use instead of default straight line move
# - x,y parking coordinates can be negative if your printer can handle it
#
# Retraction can be used to optimize stringing and blobs that can occur when
# changing tools and are active only during a print.
# IMPORTANT: For toolchanging the config order would be:
#   1. In mmu_parameters.cfg configure extruder dimensions like
#      'toolhead_extruder_to_nozzle',etc. These are based on geometry.
#   2. In mmu_parameters.cfg tweak 'toolhead_ooze_reduction' only if necessary
#      so that filament _just_ appears at the nozzle on load
#   3. Only then, adjust retraction to control stringing and blobs when
#      changing tool in a print

variable_toolchange_fan_speed   : 50		; Fan speed % if using fan_assist enabled

# Step 2 - Nozzle Separation
# The filament is then quickly separated from the meltzone by a fast movement
# before then slowing to travel the remaining distance to cooling tube. The
# initial fast movement should be as fast as extruder can comfortably perform.
# A good starting point# for slower move is unloading_speed_start/cooling_moves.
# Too fast a slower movement can lead to excessively long tips or hairs
variable_unloading_speed_start  : 80		; Speed in mm/s for initial fast movement
variable_unloading_speed        : 18		; Speed in mm/s for slow move to cooling zone

# Step 3 - Cooling Moves
# The cooling move allows the filament to harden while constantly moving back
# and forth in the cooling tube portion of the extruder to prevent a bulbous
# tip forming. The cooling tube position is measured from the internal nozzle
# to just past the top of the heater block (often it is beneficial to add a
# couple of mm to ensure the tip is in the cooling section. The cooling tube
# length is then the distance from here to top of heatsink (this is the length
# length of the cooling moves). The final cooling move is a fast movement to
# break the string formed.

variable_cooling_tube_length    : 10		; Movement length. DragonST:15, DragonHF:10, Mosquito:20, Revo:10, RapidoHF:10
variable_initial_cooling_speed  : 10		; Initial slow movement (mm/s) to solidify tip and cool string if formed
variable_final_cooling_speed    : 50		; Fast movement (mm/s) Too fast: tip deformation on eject, Too Slow: long string/no separation
variable_cooling_moves          : 4		; Number of back and forth cooling moves to make (2-4 is a good start)

# Step 4 - Skinnydip
# Skinnydip is an advanced final move that may have benefit with some
# material like PLA to burn off persistent very fine hairs. To work the
# depth of insertion is critical (start with it disabled and tune last)
# For reference the internal nozzle would be at a distance of
# cooling_tube_position + cooling_tube_length, the top of the heater
# block would be cooling_tube_length away.
variable_use_skinnydip          : False		; True = enable skinnydip, False = skinnydip move disabled
variable_skinnydip_distance     : 30		; Distance to reinsert filament into hotend starting from end of cooling tube
variable_dip_insertion_speed    : 30		; Medium/Slow insertion speed mm/s - Just long enough to melt the fine hairs, too slow will pull up molten filament
variable_dip_extraction_speed   : 70		; Speed mm/s - Around 2x Insertion speed to prevents forming new hairs
variable_melt_zone_pause        : 0		; Pause if melt zone in ms. Default 0
variable_cooling_zone_pause     : 0		; Pause if cooling zone after dip in ms. Default 0
variable_use_fast_skinnydip     : False		; False = Skip the toolhead temp change wait during skinnydip move

# Step 5 - Parking
# Park filament ready to eject
variable_parking_distance       : 0		; Position mm to park the filament at end of tip forming, 0 = leave where filament ends up after tip forming
variable_extruder_eject_speed   : 25		; Speed mm/s used for parking_distance (and final_eject when testing)
