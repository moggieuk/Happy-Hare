# load speeds depending on whether MMU thinks it is pulling from the buffer or from the spool. It is often helpful to

# These setttings control the loading and unloading filament at the gate. The primary options are you use a endstop switch
# at the gate (ala TradRack) or an encoder (ERCF default).  You can even have both a gate sensor for loading/parking and
# still use the encoder for other move verification (see advanced 'gate_endstop_to_encoder' option).
# Note: the `encoder` method, due to the nature of its operation will overshoot a little. This is not a problem in practice
# because the overshoot will simply be compensated for in the subsequent fast bowden move.
#
# Possible gate_homing_endtop names:
#   encoder       - Detect filament position using movement of the encoder
#   mmu_gate      - Use gate endstop
#   mmu_gear      - Use individual per-gate endstop (type-B MMU's)
#   extruder      - Use extruder entry sensor (Only for some type-B designs, see [mmu_machine] require_bowden_move setting)

# In addition to different bowden loading speeds for buffer and non-buffered filament it is possible to detect missed
# steps caused by "jerking" on a heavy spool. If bowden correction is enabled the driver with "believe" the encoder

bowden_pre_unload_test: 1		# 1 to check for bowden movement before full pull (slower), 0 don't check (faster). Requires Encoder

# ADVANCED: If pre-unload test is enabled, this controls the detection of successful bowden pre-unload test and represents

# Happy Hare needs a reference "homing point" close to the extruder from which to accurately complete the loading of
# the toolhead. This homing operation takes place after the fast bowden load and it is anticipated that that load
# operation will leave the filament just shy of the homing point. If using a toolhead sensor this initial extruder
# homing is unecessary (but can be forced) because the homing will occur inside the extruder for the optimum in accuracy.
#
# In addition to an entry sensor "mmu_extruder" it is possbile for Happy Hare to "feel" for the extruder gear entry
# by colliding with it. Because this method is not completely deterministic you might find have to find the sweetspot
# for your setup by adjusting the TMC current reduction. Also, touch (stallguard) sensing is possible to configure but
# unfortunately doesn't work well with some external mcu's. Note that reduced current during collision detection can
# also prevent unecessary filament griding
#
# Possible homing_endtop names:
#   collision      - Detect the collision with the extruder gear by monitoring encoder movement (Requires encoder)
#                    Fast bowden load will move to the extruder gears
#   mmu_gear_touch - Use touch detection when the gear stepper hits the extruder (Requires stallguard)
#                    Fast bowden load will move to extruder_homing_buffer distance before extruder gear
#   extruder       - If you have a "filament entry" endstop configured (Requires 'extruder' endstop)
#                    Fast bowden load will move to extruder_homing_buffer distance before sensor
#   none           - Don't attempt to home. Only possibiliy if lacking all sensor options
#                    Fast bowden load will move to the extruder gears. Fine if using toolhead sensor
# Note: The homing_endstop will be ignored if a toolhead sensor is available unless `extruder_force_homing: 1`
#
extruder_homing_max: 80			# Maximum distance to advance in order to attempt to home the extruder
extruder_homing_endstop: collision	# Filament homing method/endstop name (fallback if toolhead sensor not available)

extruder_collision_homing_current: 30	# % gear_stepper current (10%-100%) to use when homing to extruder homing (100 to disable)

# In the absence of a toolhead sensor Happy Hare will automatically default to extruder entrance detection regardless
# of this setting, however if you have a toolhead sensor you can still force the additional (unecessary) step of
# initially homing to extruder entrance then home to the toolhead sensor

# It is possible to define highly customized loading and unloading sequences, however, unless you have a specialized
# setup it is probably easier to opt for the built-in toolhead loading and unloading sequence which already offers a
# high degree of customization. If you need even more control then edit the _MMU_LOAD_SEQUENCE and _MMU_UNLOAD_SEQUENCE
# macros in mmu_sequence.cfg - but be careful!
#
# An MMU must have a known point at the end of the bowden from which it can precisely load the extruder. Generally this
# will either be the extruder extrance (which is controlled with settings above) or by homing to toolhead sensor. If
# you have toolhead sensor it is past the extruder gear and the driver needs to know the max distance (from end of
# bowden move) to attempt homing
#
toolhead_homing_max: 40			# Maximum distance to advance in order to attempt to home to defined homing endstop

# IMPORTANT: These next three settings are based on the physical dimensions of your toolhead
# Once a homing position is determined, Happy Hare needs to know the final move distance to the nozzle. There is only
# one correct value for your setup - use 'toolhead_ooze_reduction' (which corresponds to the residual filament left in
# your nozzle) to control excessive oozing on load. See doc for table of proposed values for common configurations.
#
# NOTE: If you have a toolhead sensor you can automate the calculation of these parameters! Read about the
# `MMU_CALIBRATE_TOOLHEAD` command (https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare/wiki/Blobing-and-Stringing)
#
toolhead_extruder_to_nozzle: 72		# Distance from extruder gears (entrance) to nozzle
toolhead_sensor_to_nozzle: 62		# Distance from toolhead sensor to nozzle (ignored if not fitted)
toolhead_entry_to_extruder: 8		# Distance from extruder "entry" sensor to extruder gears (ignored if not fitted)

# This setting represents how much residual filament is left behind in the nozzle when filament is removed, it is thus
# used to reduce the extruder loading length and prevent excessive blobing but also in the calculation of purge volume.
# Note that this value can also be measured with the `MMU_CALIBRATE_TOOLHEAD` procedure
#
toolhead_residual_filament: 0		# Reduction in extruder loading length because of residual filament left behind

# TUNING: Finally, this is the last resort tuning value to fix blobbing. It is expected that this value is NEAR ZERO as
# it represents a further reduction in extruder load length to fix blobbing. If using a wipetower and you experience blobs
# on it, increase this value (reduce the quantity of filament loaded). If you experience gaps, decrease this value. If gaps
# and already at 0 then perhaps the 'toolhead_extruder_to_nozzle' or 'toolhead_residual_filament' settings are incorrect.
# Similarly a value >+5mm also suggests the four settings above are not correct. Also see 'retract' setting in
# 'mmu_macro_vars.cfg' for final in-print ooze tuning.
#
toolhead_ooze_reduction: 0		# Reduction in extruder loading length to prevent ooze (represents filament remaining)

# Distance added to the extruder unload movement to ensure filament is free of extruder. This adds some degree of tolerance
# to slightly incorrect configuration or extruder slippage. However don't use as an excuse for incorrect toolhead settings
#
toolhead_unload_safety_margin: 10	# Extra movement saftey margin (default: 10mm)

# If not synchronizing gear and extruder and you experience a "false" clog detection immediately after the tool change
# it might be because of a long bowden and/or large internal diameter that causes slack in the filament. This optional
# move will tighten the filament after a load by % of current clog detection length. Gear stepper will run at 50% current
#
toolhead_post_load_tighten: 60		# % of clog detection length, 0 to disable. Ignored if 'sync_to_extruder: 1'

# ADVANCED: Controls the detection of successful extruder load/unload movement and represents the fraction of allowable
# mismatch between actual movement and that seen by encoder. Setting to 100% tolerance effectively turns off checking.
# Some designs of extruder have a short move distance that may not be picked up by encoder and cause false errors. This
# allows masking of those errors. However the error often indicates that your extruder load speed is too high or the
# friction is too high on the filament and in that case masking the error is not a good idea. Try reducing friction
# and lowering speed first!

# Tip forming responsibity can be split between slicer (in-print) and standalone macro (not in-print) or forced to always

#
# Often it is useful to increase the extruder current for the rapid movement to ensure high torque and no skipped steps

# This controls whether the extruder and gear steppers are synchronized during printing operations
# If you normally run with maxed out gear stepper current consider reducing it with 'sync_gear_current'

# This can be useful to control gear stepper temperature when printing with synchronized motor

# Optionally it is possible to leverage feedback for a "compression/expansion" sensor in the bowden path from MMU to
# extruder to ensure that the two motors are kept in sync as viewed by the filament (the signal feedback state can be
# binary supplied by one or two switches: -1 (expanded) and 1 (compressed) of proportional value between -1.0 and 1.0

# - Clog detection is available when encoder is fitted and it can detect when filament is not moving and pause the print
# - EndlessSpool feature allows detection of runout on one spool and the automatic mapping of tool to an alternative
#   gate (spool). Set to '1', this feature requires clog detection or gate sensor or pre-gate sensors. EndlessSpool
#   functionality can optionally be extended to attempt to load an empty gate with 'endless_spool_on_load'. On some MMU
#   designs (with linear selector) it can also be configured to eject filament remains to a designated gate rather than
#   defaulting to current gate. A custom gate will disable pre-gate runout detection for EndlessSpool because filament
