#
# Angle of the servo in three named positions:
#   up   = tool is selected and filament is allowed to freely move through gate
#   down = to grip filament
#   move = ready the servo for selector move (optional - defaults to up)

# Logging ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# log_level & logfile_level can be set to one of (0 = essential, 1 = info, 2 = debug, 3 = trace, 4 = stepper moves)
# Generally you can keep console logging to a minimal whilst still sending debug output to the mmu.log file
# Increasing the console log level is only really useful during initial setup to save having to constantly open the log file
#
log_level: 1
log_file_level: 3			# Can also be set to -1 to disable log file completely
log_statistics: 1 			# 1 to log statistics on every toolchange (default), 0 to disable (but still recorded)

log_startup_status: 1			# Whether to log tool to gate status on startup, 1 = summary (default), 2 = full, 0 = disable


# Movement speeds ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Long moves are faster than the small ones and used for the bulk of the bowden movement. Note that you can set two fast load
# speeds depending on whether MMU thinks it is pulling from the buffer or from the spool. It is often helpful to use a lower
# speed when pulling from the spool because more force is required to overcome friction and this prevents loosing steps.
# 100mm/s should be "quiet" with the NEMA14 motor or a NEMA17 pancake, but you can go lower for really low noise
# NOTE: Encoder cannot keep up much above 250mm/s so make sure `bowden_apply_correction` is off at very high speeds!
#
gear_from_buffer_speed: 150		# mm/s Normal speed when loading filament. Conservative is 100mm/s, Max around 300mm/s
gear_from_buffer_accel: 400		# Normal accelaration when loading filament
gear_from_spool_speed: 80		# mm/s Use (lower) speed when loading from a gate for the first time (i.e. pulling from spool)
gear_from_spool_accel: 100		# Accelaration when loading from spool
gear_short_move_speed: 80		# mm/s Speed when making short moves (like incremental retracts with encoder)
gear_short_move_accel: 400		# Usually the same as gear_from_buffer_accel (for short movements)
gear_short_move_threshold: 70		# Move distance that controls application of 'short_move' speed/accel
gear_homing_speed: 50			# mm/s Speed of gear stepper only homing moves (e.g. extruder homing)

# Speeds of extruder movement. The 'sync' speeds will be used when gear and extruder steppers are moving in sync
extruder_load_speed: 16			# mm/s speed of load move inside extruder from homing position to meltzone

# Selector movement speeds. (Accelaration is defined by physical MMU limits set above and passed to selector stepper driver)
selector_move_speed: 200		# mm/s speed of selector movement (not touch)
selector_homing_speed: 60		# mm/s speed of initial selector homing move (not touch)
selector_touch_speed: 80		# mm/s speed of all touch selector moves (if stallguard configured)

# Selector touch (stallguard) operation. If stallguard is configured, then this can be used to switch on touch movement which can detect
# blocked filament path and try to recover automatically but it is slower and more difficult to set up (still recommend physical endstop switch)
#
selector_touch_enable: 0		# If selector touch operation is possible this can be used to disable it 1=enabled, 0=disabled


# Gate loading/unloading ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These setttings control the loading and unloading filament at the gate. The primary options are you use a endstop switch
# at the gate (ala TradRack) or an encoder (ERCF default).  You can even have both a gate sensor for loading/parking and still use
# the encoder for other move verification (see advanced 'gate_endstop_to_encoder' option).
# Note: the `encoder` method, due to the nature of its operation will overshoot a little. This is not a problem in practice
# because the overshoot will simply be compensated for in the subsequent fast bowden move.
# 
# Possible gate_homing_endtop names:
#   encoder  - Detect filament position using movement of the encoder
#   mmu_gate - Detect filament using a gate endstop if configured
#
gate_homing_endstop: {gate_homing_endstop}		# Name of gate endstop, "encoder" forces use of encoder for parking
gate_homing_max: 70			# Maximum move distance to home to the gate (actual move distance for encoder parking)
gate_unload_buffer: 50			# Amount to reduce the fast unload so that filament doesn't overshoot when parking
gate_load_retries: 2			# Number of times MMU will attempt to grab the filament on initial load (max 5)
gate_parking_distance: {gate_parking_distance} 		# ADVANCED: Parking postion in the gate (distance back from gate endstop/encoder point)
gate_endstop_to_encoder: {gate_endstop_to_encoder}		# ADVANCED: Distance between gate endstop and encoder (IF both fitted. +ve if encoder after endstop)


# Bowden tube loading/unloading --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# In addition to different bowden loading speeds for buffer and non-buffered filament it is possible to detect missed steps
# caused by "jerking" on a heavy spool. If bowden correction is enabled the driver with "believe" the encoder reading and
# make correction moves to bring the filament to within the 'bowden_allowable_load_delta' of the end of bowden position
# (this does require a reliable encoder and is not recommended for very high speed loading >200mm/s)
#
bowden_apply_correction: 0		# 1 to enable, 0 disabled (default) [Requires Encoder]
bowden_allowable_load_delta: 20.0	# How close in mm the correction moves will attempt to get to target [Requires Encoder]
#
# This test verifies the filament is free of extruder before the fast bowden movement to reduce possibility of grinding filament
bowden_pre_unload_test: 1		# 1 to check for bowden movement before full pull (slower), 0 don't check (faster) [Requires Encoder]
#
# ADVANCED: If pre-unload test is enabled, this controls the detection of successful bowden pre-unload test and represents the
# fraction of allowable mismatch between actual movement and that seen by encoder. Setting to 50% tolerance usually works well.
# Increasing will make test more tolerent. Value of 100% essentially disables error detection
bowden_pre_unload_error_tolerance: 50


# Extruder homing ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Happy Hare needs a reference "homing point" close to the extruder from which to accurately complete the loading of the toolhead.
# This homing operation takes place after the fast bowden load and it is anticipated that that load operation will leave the
# filament just shy of the homing point. If using a toolhead sensor this initial extruder homing is unecessary (but can be forced)
# because the homing will occur inside the extruder for the optimum in accuracy.
#
# In addition to an entry sensor "mmu_extruder" it is possbile for Happy Hare to "feel" for the extruder gear entry by colliding
# with it. Because this method is not completely deterministic you might find have to find the sweetspot for your setup by adjusting
# the TMC current reduction. Also, touch (stallguard) sensing is possible to configure but unfortunately doesn't work well with
# some external EASY-BRD or ERB mcu's. Note that reduced current during collision detection can also prevent unecessary filament griding.
#
# Possible homing_endtop names:
#   collision      - Detect the collision with the extruder gear by monitoring encoder movement (Requires encoder)
#   mmu_gear_touch - Use touch detection when the gear stepper hits the extruder (Requires stallguard)
#   extruder       - If you have a "filament entry" endstop configured (Requires 'extruder' endstop)
#   none           - Don't attempt to home. Only possibiliy if lacking all sensor options (not recommended)
# Note: The homing_endstop will be ignored if a toolhead sensor is available unless `extruder_force_homing: 1`
#
extruder_homing_max: 80			# Maximum distance to advance in order to attempt to home the extruder
extruder_homing_endstop: {extruder_homing_endstop}	# Filament homing method/endstop name
extruder_homing_current: 40		# % gear_stepper current (10%-100%) to use when homing to extruder homing (100 to disable)
#
# In the absence of a toolhead sensor Happy Hare will automatically default to extruder entrance detection regardless of
# this setting, however if you have a toolhead sensor you can still force the additional (unecessary) step of initially homing to
# extruder entrance then homing to the toolhead sensor
extruder_force_homing: 0


# Default toolhead loading and unloading ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# It is possible to define highly customized loading and unloading sequences, however, unless you have a specialized setup
# it is probably easier to opt for the built-in toolhead loading and unloading sequence which already offers a high degree
# of customization. If you need even more control then edit the _MMU_LOAD_SEQUENCE and _MMU_UNLOAD_SEQUENCE macros in
# mmu_software.cfg - but be careful!
#
# An MMU must have a known point at the end of the bowden from which it can precisely load the extruder. Generally this will
# either be the extruder extrance (which is controlled with settings above) or by homing to toolhead sensor. If you have
# toolhead sensor it is past the extruder gear and the driver needs to know the max distance (from end of bowden move) to
# attempt homing
#
toolhead_homing_max: 40			# Maximum distance to advance in order to attempt to home to toolhead sensor
#
# Once a homing position is determined, Happy Hare needs to know the final move distance to the nozzle. If homing to
# toolhead sensor this will be the distance from the toolhead sensor to the nozzle. If extruder homing it will be the
# distance from the extruder gears to the nozzle. Set the appropriate parameter for your setup
#
# This value can be determined by manually inserting filament to your homing point (extruder gears or toolhead sensor)
# and advancing it 1-2mm at a time until it starts to extrude from the nozzle.  Subtract 1-2mm from that distance distance
# to get this value.  If you have large gaps in your purge tower, increase this value.  If you have blobs, reduce this value.
# This value will depend on your extruder, hotend and nozzle setup.
# (Note that the difference between these two represents the extruder entrance to toolhead sensor distance and is used as
# the final unload distance from extruder. An accurate setting can reduce tip noise/grinding on exit from extruder)
toolhead_extruder_to_nozzle: 72		# E.g. Revo Voron with CW2 extruder using extruder homing
toolhead_sensor_to_nozzle: 62		# E.g. Revo Voron with CW2 extruder with (enabled) toolhead sensor
#
# If toolhead has an entry sensor then this is the distance from sensor to extruder entry
toolhead_entry_to_extruder: 8		# E.g. Revo Voron with CW2 extruder with (enabled) entry sensor
#
# Distance added to the extruder unload movement to ensure filament is free of extruder. This distance will only ever be moved
# under extruder stepper control so it will never result in excessive unloading, however, don't use as an excuse
# for incorrect toolhead settings above. Default: 10mm
toolhead_unload_safety_margin: 10
#
# ADVANCED: Controls the detection of successful extruder load/unload movement and represents the fraction of allowable
# mismatch between actual movement and that seen by encoder. Setting to 100% tolerance effectively turns off checking.
# Some designs of extruder have a short move distance that may not be picked up by encoder and cause false errors. This allows
# masking of those errors. However the error often indicates that your extruder load speed is too high or the friction is too
# high on the filament and in that case masking the error is not a good idea. Try reducing friction and lowering speed first!
toolhead_move_error_tolerance: 60


# Tip forming -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Tip forming responsibity is typically split between slicer (in-print) and standalone macro (not in-print). Whilst there is
# an option to choose for every toolchange, setting 'force_form_tip_standalone: 1' will always do the standalone sequence.
# Frankly it is usually recommended to disable tip forming in your slicer and to do exclusively in Happy Hare so tuning only
# has to be done in one place.
#
# When Happy Hare is asked to form a tip it will run the referenced macro. Two are reference examples are provided:
#   _MMU_FORM_TIP_STANDALONE .. default tip forming similar to popular slicers like Superslicer and Prusaslicer
#   _MMU_CUT_TIP             .. for Filametrix (ERCFv2) style toolhead filament cutting system
#
# Often it is useful to increase the current for the (generally) rapid movement to ensure high torque and no skipped steps
#
# If opting for slicer tip forming you must configure where the slicer leaves the filament in the extruder since there
# is no way to determine this. This can be ignored if all tip forming is performed by Happy Hare
#
force_form_tip_standalone: 0		 # 0 = Default smart behavior, 1 = Always do standalone tip forming (TURN SLICER OFF!)
form_tip_macro: _MMU_FORM_TIP_STANDALONE # Name of macro to call to perform the tip forming (or cutting) operation
extruder_form_tip_current: 100		 # % of extruder current (100%-150%) to use when forming tip (100 to disable)
slicer_tip_park_pos: 0			 # This specifies the position of filament in extruder after slicer tip forming move


# Synchronized gear/extruder movement --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This controls whether the extruder and gear steppers are synchronized during printing operations
# If you normally run with maxed out gear stepper current consider reducing it with 'sync_gear_current'
# If equipped with TMC drivers the current of the gear and extruder motors can be controlled to optimize performance.
# This can be useful to control gear stepper temperature when printing with synchronized motor
#
sync_to_extruder: 0			# Gear motor is synchronized to extruder during print
sync_gear_current: 50			# % of gear_stepper current (10%-100%) to use when syncing with extruder during print
sync_form_tip: 0			# Synchronize during standalone tip formation (initial part of unload)
#
# Optionally it is possible to leverage feedback for a "compression/expansion" sensor in the bowden path from MMU to extruder
# to ensure that the two motors are kept in sync as viewed by the filament (the signal feedback state can be binary supplied
# by one or two switches: -1 (expanded) and 1 (compressed) of proportional value between -1.0 and 1.0
# Requires [mmu_sensors] setting
#
sync_feedback_enable: 0			# 0 = Turn off (even with fitted sensor), 1 = Turn on when printing
sync_multiplier_high: 1.05		# Maximum factor to apply to gear stepper `rotation_distance`
sync_multipler_low: 0.95		# Minimum factor to apply


# Feature Options --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# - Clog detection is available when encoder is fitted and it can detect when filament is not moving and pause the print.
# - EndlessSpool feature allows detection of runout on one spool and the automatic mapping of tool to an alternative
#   gate (spool). Set to '1', this feature requires clog detection or gate sensor or pre-gate sensors. EndlessSpool
#   functionality can optionally be extended to attempt to load an empty gate with 'endless_spool_on_load'
# - Spoolman support will use the SpoolId configured with the gate to load filament details and color from spoolman.
#
enable_clog_detection: 2	# 0 = disable, 1 = static length clog detection, 2 = automatic length clog detection
enable_endless_spool: 1		# 0 = disable, 1 = enable endless spool
endless_spool_on_load: 0	# 0 = don't apply endless spool on load, 1 = run endless spool if gate is empty
endless_spool_final_eject: 50	# Extra unload distance on runout to prevent accidental reload
enable_spoolman: 0		# 0 = disable spoolman support,  1 = enable spoolman (requires spoolman setup)


# Turn on behavior -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# MMU can auto-initialize based on previous persisted state. There are 5 levels with each level bringing in
# additional state information requiring progressively less inital setup. The higher level assume that you don't touch
# MMU while it is offline and it can come back to life exactly where it left off!  If you do touch it or get confused
# then issue an appropriate reset command (E.g. MMU_RESET) to get state back to the defaults.
# Enabling `startup_status` is recommended if you use persisted state at level 2 and above
# Levels: 0 = start fresh every time except calibration data (the former default behavior)
#         1 = restore persisted endless spool groups
#         2 = additionally restore persisted tool-to-gate mapping
#         3 = additionally restore persisted gate status (filament availability, material and color, spoolID) (default)
#         4 = additionally restore persisted tool, gate and filament position! (Recommended when MMU is working well)
#
persistence_level: 3

strict_filament_recovery: 0	# If enabled with MMU with toolhead sensor, this will cause filament position recovery to
				# perform extra moves to look for filament trapped in the space after extruder but before sensor
retry_tool_change_on_error: 0	# Whether to automatically retry a failed tool change. If enabled Happy Hare will perform
				# the equivalent of 'MMU_RECOVER' + 'Tx' commands which usually is all that is necessary
				# to recover. Note that enabling this can mask problems with your MMU
print_start_detection: 1	# Enabled for Happy Hare to automatically detect start and end of print and call
				# _MMU_START_PRINT and _MMU_END_PRINT. Disable if you want to include in your own macros
encoder_move_validation: 1	# 1 = Normally Encoder validates move distances are within given tolerance (slower but more safe)
				# 0 = Validation is disabled for many moves (eliminates slight pause between moves but less safe)


# ADVANCED: MMU macro overrides --- ONLY SET IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH KLIPPER MACROS -----------------------------------
#
# When a print or the MMU should be paused, Happy Hare will call the `PAUSE` macro by default. If you want additional
# behavior, you can override the macro that is called by Happy Hare. Some examples as to why you may want this:
# 1. You are using a sparse purge tower and you want Happy Hare errors to park above your purge tower as to not hit
#    any models that are between your tower and normal pause location
# 2. You want to additionally call a macro that sends a push notification on filament swap error
# 3. You want to set additional static arguments to either the default pause macro or your own macro
#
# IMPORTANT: Whatever macro you call _must_ ultimately leave the printer in a paused state. Failure to do so will result
#            in failed prints, jams, and physical hardware crashes
#
pause_macro: PAUSE
