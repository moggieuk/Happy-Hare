# Long moves are faster than the small ones and used for the bulk of the bowden movement. You can set two fast load speeds
# depending on whether pulling from the spool or filament buffer (if fitted and not the first time load). This can be helpful

# These settings control the loading and unloading filament at the gate which is the parking position inside the MMU.

bowden_homing_max: 2000			# Maximum attempted bowden move (for calibration). Should be larger than your actual bowden!

# If you MMU is equiped with an encoder the following options are available:
# 
# In addition to different bowden loading speeds for buffer and non-buffered filament it is possible to detect missed
# steps caused by "jerking" on a heavy spool. If bowden correction is enabled Happy Hare will "believe" the encoder
# reading and make correction moves to bring the filament to within the 'bowden_allowable_load_delta' of the end of
# bowden position (this does require a reliable encoder and is not recommended for very high speed loading >350mm/s)
#
bowden_apply_correction: 0		# 1 to enable, 0 disabled
bowden_allowable_load_delta: 20.0	# How close in mm the correction moves will attempt to get to target
#
# This saftey check uses the encoder to verify the filament is free of extruder before the fast bowden movement to
# reduce possibility of grinding filament. If enabled the trigger can be tuned by setting the "error tolerance" which
# represents the fraction of allowable mismatch between actual movement and that seen by encoder. Setting to 50% tolerance
# usually works well. Increasing will make test more tolerant. Value of 100% essentially disables error detection

# Happy Hare needs a reference "homing point" close to the extruder from which to accurately complete the loading of
# the toolhead. This homing operation takes place after the fast bowden load and it is anticipated that that load
# operation will leave the filament just shy of the homing point. If using a toolhead sensor this initial extruder
# homing is unnecessary (but can be forced) because the homing will occur inside the extruder for the optimum in accuracy.
# You still should set this homing method because it is also used for the determination and calibration of bowden length.
#
# In addition to an entry sensor "extruder" it is possible for Happy Hare to "feel" for the extruder gear entry
# by colliding with it. This can be done with encoder based collision detection, the compression of the sync-feedback
# (aka buffer) sensor or using "touch" (stallguard) on the gear stepper. Note that encoder collision detection is not
# completely deterministic and you will have to find the sweetspot for your setup by adjusting the TMC current reduction.
# Note that reduced current during collision detection can also prevent unecessary filament griding.
#
# Possible extruder_homing_endtop names:
#   collision            - Detect the collision with the extruder gear by monitoring encoder movement (Requires encoder)
#                          Fast bowden load will move to the extruder gears
#   mmu_gear_touch       - Use touch detection when the gear stepper hits the extruder (Requires stallguard)
#                          Fast bowden load will move to extruder_homing_buffer distance before extruder gear, then home
#   extruder             - If you have a "filament entry" endstop configured (Requires 'extruder' endstop)
#                          Fast bowden load will move to extruder_homing_buffer distance before sensor, then home
#   filament_compression - If you have a "sync-feedback" sensor with compression switch configured
#                          Fast bowden load will move to extruder_homing_buffer distance before extruder gear, then home
#   none                 - Don't attempt to home. Only possibiliy if lacking all sensor options
#                          Fast bowden load will move to the extruder gears. Option is fine if using toolhead sensor
# Note: The homing_endstop will be ignored ("none") if a toolhead sensor is available unless "extruder_force_homing: 1"

# It is possible to define highly customized loading and unloading sequences, however, unless you have a specialized
# setup it is probably easier to opt for the built-in toolhead loading and unloading sequence which already offers a
# high degree of customization. If you need even more control then edit the _MMU_LOAD_SEQUENCE and _MMU_UNLOAD_SEQUENCE
# macros in mmu_sequence.cfg - but be careful!
#
# An MMU must have a known point at the end of the bowden from which it can precisely load the extruder. Generally this
# will either be the extruder entrance (which is controlled with settings above) or by homing to toolhead sensor. If
# you have toolhead sensor it is past the extruder gear and the driver needs to know the max distance (from end of
# bowden move) to attempt homing
#
toolhead_homing_max: 40			# Maximum distance to advance in order to attempt to home to defined homing endstop

# IMPORTANT: These next three settings are based on the physical dimensions of your toolhead
# Once a homing position is determined, Happy Hare needs to know the final move distance to the nozzle. There is only
# one correct value for your setup - use 'toolhead_ooze_reduction' (which corresponds to the residual filament left in
# your nozzle) to control excessive oozing on load. See doc for table of proposed values for common configurations.
#
# NOTE: If you have a toolhead sensor you can automate the calculation of these parameters! Read about the
# `MMU_CALIBRATE_TOOLHEAD` command (https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare/wiki/Blobbing-and-Stringing#---calibrating-toolhead)
#
toolhead_extruder_to_nozzle: 72		# Distance from extruder gears (entrance) to nozzle
toolhead_sensor_to_nozzle: 62		# Distance from toolhead sensor to nozzle (ignored if not fitted)
toolhead_entry_to_extruder: 8		# Distance from extruder "entry" sensor to extruder gears (ignored if not fitted)

# This setting represents how much residual filament is left behind in the nozzle when filament is removed, it is thus
# used to reduce the extruder loading length and prevent excessive blobbing but also in the calculation of purge volume.
# Note that this value can also be measured with the `MMU_CALIBRATE_TOOLHEAD` procedure
#
toolhead_residual_filament: 0		# Reduction in extruder loading length because of residual filament left behind

# TUNING: Finally, this is the last resort tuning value to fix blobbing. It is expected that this value is NEAR ZERO as
# it represents a further reduction in extruder load length to fix blobbing. If using a wipetower and you experience blobs
# on it, increase this value (reduce the quantity of filament loaded). If you experience gaps, decrease this value. If gaps
# and already at 0 then perhaps the 'toolhead_extruder_to_nozzle' or 'toolhead_residual_filament' settings are incorrect.
# Similarly a value >+5mm also suggests the four settings above are not correct. Also see 'retract' setting in
# 'mmu_macro_vars.cfg' for final in-print ooze tuning.
#
toolhead_ooze_reduction: 0		# Reduction in extruder loading length to prevent ooze (represents filament remaining)

# Distance added to the extruder unload movement to ensure filament is free of extruder. This adds some degree of tolerance
# to slightly incorrect configuration or extruder slippage. However don't use as an excuse for incorrect toolhead settings
#
toolhead_unload_safety_margin: 10	# Extra movement safety margin (default: 10mm)

# If not synchronizing gear and extruder and you experience a "false" clog detection immediately after the tool change
# it might be because of a long bowden and/or large internal diameter that causes slack in the filament. This optional
# move will tighten the filament after a load by % of current clog detection length. Gear stepper will run at 50% current
#
toolhead_post_load_tighten: 60		# % of clog detection length, 0 to disable. Ignored if 'sync_to_extruder: 1'

# If synchronizing gear and extruder and you have a sync-feedback "buffer" this setting determines whether to use it
# to create neutral tension after loading
toolhead_post_load_tension_adjust: 1	# 1 to enable (recommended), 0 to disable

# ADVANCED: Controls the detection of successful extruder load/unload movement and represents the fraction of allowable
# mismatch between actual movement and that seen by encoder. Setting to 100% tolerance effectively turns off checking.
# Some designs of extruder have a short move distance that may not be picked up by encoder and cause false errors. This
# allows masking of those errors. However the error often indicates that your extruder load speed is too high or the
# friction is too high on the filament and in that case masking the error is not a good idea. Try reducing friction
# and lowering speed first!

# NOTE: For MMU located cutting like the optional EREC cutter you should set still this to _MMU_FORM_TIP to build a decent

# Often it is useful to increase the extruder current for the rapid movement to ensure high torque and no skipped steps

# Happy Hare but you can also build your own custom one:
#   _MMU_PURGE .. default purging that just dumps the desired amount of filament (setup correct parking before enabling this!)
#   BLOBIFER   .. for excellent Blobifer addon (https://github.com/Dendrowen/Blobifier)
#
# Often it is useful to increase the extruder current for the often rapid puring movement to ensure high torque and no skipped steps
#
force_purge_standalone: 0 		# 0 = Slicer wipetower in print else standalone, 1 = Always standalone purging (TURN WIPETOWER OFF!)
purge_macro: _MMU_PURGE			# Name of macro to call to perform the standalone purging operation. E.g. BLOBIFIER, _MMU_PURGE
extruder_purge_current: 100		# % of extruder current (100%-150%) to use when purging (100 to disable)

# This controls whether the extruder and gear steppers are synchronized during printing operations
# If you normally run with maxed out gear stepper current consider reducing it with 'sync_gear_current'
# If equipped with TMC drivers the current of the gear and extruder motors can be controlled to optimize performance.
# This can be useful to control gear stepper temperature when printing with synchronized motor
#
sync_gear_current: 70			# % of gear_stepper current (10%-100%) to use when syncing with extruder during print

# Optionally it is possible to leverage feedback from a "compression/expansion" sensor (aka "buffer") in the bowden
# path from MMU to extruder to ensure that the two motors are kept in sync as viewed by the filament (the signal feedback
# state can be binary supplied by one or two switches: -1 (expanded) and 1 (compressed) of proportional value between
# -1.0 and 1.0.
#
# If only "one half" of the sync-feedback is available (either compression-only or tension-only) then the rotation
# distance is always shifted based on the high/low multipliers, however if both tension and compression are available
# then the rotation distance will autotune to correct setting (recommend you also enable 'autotune_rotation_distance: 1'

# If your MMU has a dc motor (often N20) controlled respooler/assist then how it operates can be controlled with these

# These are auto calibration/tuning settings that can be used to ease initial setup and/or to tune calibration over
# time based on measured telemetry. Whether these auto-tuning features are available depends on MMU design and
# configured sensors (explained below). The setting will be ignored if the required sensors are not available but if
# they can operate they will suppress the normal calibration warnings (MMU_STATUS can still be used to view them).
# Note that these are initially set by the installer to recommended values
#
#  autocal_bowden_length      - the calibrated bowden length will be established on first load. It can also be set
#                               manually or reset with MMU_CALIBRATE_BOWDEN. Best results require the use of
#                               sync-feedback-compression or extruder sensor but gear-touch or encoder will also work.
#                               'extruder_homing_endstop' cannot be 'none'
#  autotune_bowden_length     - Once calibrated this setting will tune the bowden distance over time. Works best with
#                               toolhead sensor
#  skip_cal_rotation_distance - This will rely on installed default value (although it can still be calibrated). Usually
#                               a good choice if autotune is enabled
#  autotune_rotation_distance - Requires sync-feedback sensor (aka "buffer") with both compression and tension switches
#                               or accurately calibrated encoder (encoder works only with gate 0)
#  skip_cal_encoder           - Will rely on installed default value (although it can still be calibrates).
#                               Not recommended but allows for easier initial setup especially when 'autotune_encoder'

# These are the values that the various "RESET" commands will reset too rather than the built-in defaults. The lenght
# of the lists must match the number of gates on your MMU
#
# e.g. MMU_GATE_MAP RESET=1              - will use all the 'gate_XXX' values
#      MMU_TTG_MAP RESET=1               - will use the 'tool_to_gate_map'
#      MMU_ENDLESS_SPOOL_GROUPS RESET=1  - will use the 'endless_spool_groups'
