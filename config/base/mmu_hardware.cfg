## Happy Hare MMU hardware config file with config for {brd_type}
##
## Common external mcus:
## 1) EASY-BRD
##  J6 Jumper setting
##   Option 1: Pins 2-3 and 4-5, i.e.  .[..][..] (recommended)
##   This allows for option of "touch" selector setup. Note that this enables the option disables the "extra"
##   switch so the toolhead sensor (if used) would have to be connected to the main mcu
##
##   Option 2: Pins 1-2 and 4-5, i.e.  [..].[..]
##   It you don't care about selector touch operation. The "extra" switch is enabled for other uses
##
##  Note that the EASY-BRD does not expose the DIAG pin for the gear stepper
##
## 2) Fysetc Burrows ERB
##  No jumper configuration is required for Fysetc Burrows ERB board. Both Selector and Gear DIAG pins are exposed
##
##  ERB firmware flashing notes:
##   Must have 12v/24v supply connected
##    > make menuconfig (rpi2040, No bootloader)
##    > make
##  Put card in boot loader mode: Press & Hold 'BOOTSEL' ; click 'RST; ; Release 'BOOTSEL'
##    > make flash FLASH_DEVICE=2e8a:0003
##
## ------
##
## Note about "touch" endstops: Happy Hare provides extremely flexible homing options using both single steppers or synced steppers.
## The "touch" options leverage stallguard and thus require the appropriate 'diag_pin' and stallguard parameters set on the TMC driver
## section.  If you have the diag_pin exposed, it is harmless to define this because they will only be used when explicitly needed
## and configured.
##
## Touch option for each stepper provides these benefits / possibilities:
##  - on extruder stepper allows for the automatic detection of the nozzle!!
##  - on selector stepper allows for the automatic detection of filament stuck in the gate and subsequent recovery
##  - on gear stepper allows for the automatic detection of the extruder entrance
##
## These sound wonderful right?  They are, but there are caveats:
##  - The external EASY-BRD and ERB mcu's are terrible at detecting stallguard and often result in an "undervoltage error". It is generally
##    possible to get selector touch (TMC2209) tuned especially if you set 'stealthchop_threshold' to a value greater than homing speeds and
##    less than move speed. I.e. the stepper runs in stealthchop mode when homing. [klipper experts will know that it switches the chip mode
##    automatically to stealthchop and then back for Stallguard2 support, howver the automatic switching back to spreadcycle at the end homing
##    move seems to provoke the error condition and setting 'shealthchip_threshold' appropriately avoids this condition. More than you wanted
##    to know I'm sure!
##  - I have not had much luck with touch (stallguard) on the gear stepper with EASY-BRD and ERB mcu's and you really want the extra torque
##    of spreadcycle so adjusting 'stealthchop_threshold' is not really an option
##  - Enabling on the extruder stepper is viable but you will likley have to change jumpers on your main mcu to expose the DIAG pin for
##    whichever driver the extruder stepper is connected to.
##
## In summary, "touch" homing with your MMU is an advanced option that requires patience and careful tuning.  Luckily everything works with
## regular endstops and there are creative workaround options for certain homing points (like extruder entry) in the absence of any endstop.
## I'm really interested in creative setups that you come up with. Ping me on Discord (moggieuk#6538)

# HOMING CAPABLE EXTRUDER --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# With Happy Hare installed the extruder can be homed.  You will find the usual 'endstop' parameters can be added to your
# '[extruder]' section.  Useless you have some clever load cell attached to your nozzle it only really makes sense to configure 
# stallguard style "touch" homing. To do this add lines similar to this to your existing '[extruder]' definition whether
# you have it defined in printer.cfg.
#
#    [extruder]
#    endstop_pin: tmc2209_extruder:virtual_endstop

# Also be sure to add the appropriate stallguard config to the TMC section, e.g.

#    diag_pin: E_DIAG			# Set to MCU pin connected to TMC DIAG pin for extruder
#    driver_SGTHRS: 100			# 255 is most sensitive value, 0 is least sensitive

# MMU OPTIONAL NEOPIXEL LED SUPPORT ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Define neopixel LEDs for your MMU. The chain_count should match or be greater than your number of gates.
# Requires the installation of Julian Schill's awesome LED effect module: https://github.com/julianschill/klipper-led_effect
# LED index 1..N should be connected from gate #0 to gate #N
# LED index N+1 can optionally be connected to exit from MMU (like encoder in ERCF design)
#
[neopixel mmu_leds]
pin: mmu:MMU_NEOPIXEL
chain_count: {mmu_num_leds}		# Number gates + 1 (if you want exit effect)
color_order: GRBW			# Set based on your particular neopixel specification

#
# Define LED effects for MMU gate. 'mmu_led_effect' is a wrapper for led_effect
# (if included on your system) and will accept and create the defined effect on both
# the entire specified part of the strip with the name you supply but also on each
# individual LED up to N+1 gates by adding `_<gate+1>` suffix. This makes it much
# easier to have per gate effects.
#
# E.g. You define mmu_flash on a 3 gate MMU:
#  [mmu_led_effect mmu_flash]
#
# This will create effects:
#  mmu_flash on whole define strip
#  mmu_flash_1 on for gate 0 (LED index 1)
#  mmu_flash_2 on for gate 1 (LED index 2)
#  mmu_flash_3 on for gate 2 (LED index 3)
#  mmu_flash_4 for MMU exit  (LED index 4)
#
# Then you can set effects with commands like:
#  SET_LED_EFFECT EFFECT=_mmu_flash      # apply effect to all leds in strip
#  SET_LED_EFFECT EFFECT=_mmu_flash_1    # apply effect to the second led (gate 0)
#
# or set simple RBGW color with commands like:
#  SET_LED LED=mmu_led INDEX=2 RED=50 GREEN=50 BLUE=50 WHITE=0 TRANSMIT=1
#
# Note that gates start from 0, LED index starts from 1, so by default, index = gate + 1
# Ranges are constrained as much as possible to allow for additional custom LEDs
# to be wired after the N+1 position
