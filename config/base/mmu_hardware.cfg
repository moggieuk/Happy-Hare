# Goal: Happy Hare MMU hardware config file with config for {param_board_type} MCU board
#
# (\_/)
# ( *,*)
# (")_(") Happy Hare Ready
#
#
# Notes about setup of common external MCUs can be found here:
#  https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare/blob/main/doc/mcu_notes.md
# 
# Note about "touch" endstops: Happy Hare provides extremely flexible homing options using both single steppers or
# synced steppers. The "touch" option leverages stallguard and thus requires the appropriate 'diag_pin' and stallguard
# parameters set on the TMC driver section. If you have the diag_pin exposed, it is harmless to define this because
# they will only be used when explicitly needed and configured.
#
# Touch option for each stepper provides these benefits / possibilities (experimental):
#  - on extruder stepper allows for the automatic detection of the nozzle!
#  - on selector stepper allows for the automatic detection of filament stuck in the gate and subsequent recovery
#  - on gear stepper allows for the automatic detection of the extruder entrance
#
# These sound wonderful right?  They are, but there are caveats:
#  - Some external MCUs are terrible at detecting stallguard and often result in an "undervoltage error"
#    It is generally possible to get selector touch (TMC2209) tuned especially if you set 'stealthchop_threshold'
#    to a value greater than homing speeds and less than move speed. I.e. the stepper runs in stealthchop mode when
#    homing. [klipper experts will know that it switches the chip mode automatically to stealthchop and then back for
#    Stallguard2 support, however the automatic switching back to spreadcycle at the end homing move seems to provoke
#    the error condition and setting 'stealthchop_threshold' appropriately avoids this condition. More than you wanted
#    to know I'm sure!
#  - I have not had much luck with touch (stallguard) on the gear stepper with EASY-BRD and ERB MCUs and you really
#    want the extra torque of spreadcycle so adjusting 'stealthchop_threshold' is not really an option
#  - Enabling on the extruder stepper is viable but you will likely have to change jumpers on your main mcu to expose
#    the DIAG pin for whichever driver the extruder stepper is connected to.
#
# In summary, "touch" homing with your MMU is an advanced option that requires patience and careful tuning. Everything
# works with regular endstops and there are workaround options for certain homing points (like extruder entry) in
# the absence of any endstop. I'm really interested in creative setups. Ping me on Discord (moggieuk#6538)
#
# See 'mmu.cfg' for serial definition and pins aliases
#
# HOMING CAPABLE EXTRUDER (VERY ADVANCED) -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# With Happy Hare installed even the extruder can be homed. You will find the usual 'endstop' parameters can be added
# to your '[extruder]' section.  Useless you have some clever load cell attached to your nozzle it only really makes
# sense to configure stallguard style "touch" homing. To do this add lines similar to this to your existing
# '[extruder]' definition in printer.cfg.
#
#    [extruder]
#    endstop_pin: tmc2209_extruder:virtual_endstop
#
# Also be sure to add the appropriate stallguard config to the TMC section, e.g.
#
#    [tmc2209 extruder]
#    diag_pin: E_DIAG		# Set to MCU pin connected to TMC DIAG pin for extruder
#    driver_SGTHRS: 100		# 255 is most sensitive value, 0 is least sensitive
#
# Happy Hare will take care of the rest and add a 'mmu_ext_touch' endstop automatically

# MMU LED EFFECT SEGMENTS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define neopixel LEDs for your MMU. The chain_count must be large enough for your desired ranges:
#   exit   .. this set of LEDs, one for every gate, usually would be mounted at the exit point of the gate
#   entry  .. this set of LEDs, one for every gate, could be mounted at the entry point of filament into the MMU/buffer
#   status .. these LED. represents the status of the MMU (and selected filament). More than one status LED is possible
#   logo   .. these LEDs don't change during operation and are designed for driving a logo. More than one logo LED is possible
#
# Note that all sets are optional. You can opt to just have the 'exit' set for example. The advantage to having
# both entry and exit LEDs is, for example, so that 'entry' can display gate status while 'exit' displays the color
# 
# The animation effects requires the installation of Julian Schill's awesome LED effect module otherwise the LEDs
# will be static:
#   https://github.com/julianschill/klipper-led_effect
#
# LED's are indexed in the chain from 1..N. Thus to set up LED's on 'exit' and a single 'status' LED on a 4 gate MMU:
#
#    exit_leds:   neopixel:mmu_leds (1,2,3,4)
#    status_leds: neopixel:mmu_leds (5)
#
# In this example no 'entry' set is configured. Note that constructs like "mmu_leds (1-3,4)" are also valid
#
# The range is completely flexible and can be comprised of different led strips, individual LEDs, or combinations of
# both on different pins. In addition, the ordering is flexible based on your wiring, thus (1-4) and (4-1) both represent
# the same LED range but mapped to increasing or decreasing gates respectively. E.g if you have two Box Turtle MMUs, one
# with a chain of LEDs wired in reverse order and another with individual LEDs, to define 8 exit LEDs:
#
#   exit_leds: neopixel:bt_1 (4-1)
#              neopixel:bt_2a
#              neopixel:bt_2b
#              neopixel:bt_2c
#              neopixel:bt_2d
#
# Note the use of separate lines for each part of the definition,
#
# ADVANCED: Happy Hare provides a convenience wrapper [mmu_led_effect] that not only creates an effect on each of the
# [mmu_leds] specified segments as a whole but also each individual LED for atomic control. See mmu_leds.cfg for examples

# (comment out this whole section if you don't have/want leds; uncomment/edit LEDs fitted on your MMU)
