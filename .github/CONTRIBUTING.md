## How to contribute to Happy Hare

#### **Do you need help with your setup?**

* Please ask your questions in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/HXEHUb9W) instead. Github issues is meant for bugs and feature requests, not your specific setup problems.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare/issues).

* If you're unable to find an issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much **relevant information** as possible and **log files**.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

* Changes that break existing setups will probably be rejected.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
