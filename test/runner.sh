# NOTE: in order for tests to get picked up automatically, you must do the following:
#   1. Create a file in the test directory with the name test_*.py
#   2. Create a class in that file that inherits from unittest.TestCase
#   3. Ensure that each test directory has a blank file named `__init__.py`

if [ -n "$1" ]; then
  python -m unittest -k "$@" 
else
  python -m unittest
fi
